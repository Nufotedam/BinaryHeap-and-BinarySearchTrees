# BinaryHeap-and-BinarySearchTrees
Binary Heap and Binary Search Tree methods developed in Java.

Different methods with two data structures with different uses and different features.

A Binary Heap is a Complete Binary Tree. A binary heap is typically represented as an array.

Binary Search Tree is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:

- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
- The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.
